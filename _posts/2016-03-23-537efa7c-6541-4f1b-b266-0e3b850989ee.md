> Many years ago I believed I would never need to write a resume, I believed that I would inherit all that life had to offer me. 

> This optimistic lifestyle presented me the path of discovery which provided the opportunity to freely learn as much as possible and to experience all sorts of perspectives. 

> After high school I was accepted into university and was as happy as any, however, again I felt like I didn't belong to the group of students who were destined to be doctors, lawyers or engineers. So I roamed the halls sitting in classes that caught my attention be it related to engineering, law or medicine. As the years went by so did my choices of majors and years later I found myself nearly completing a double major in neuroscience and psychology at the University of Toronto with dreams to discover the secrets behind Piaget's theory of development, instead during that winter break I discovered that my father had terminal cancer and realized I may never finish my degree. 

> After learning how to live without my father, his guidance and his compassion, I discovered another outlet for my passion and completed my architectural education at the Northern Alberta Institution of Technology and began to appreciate all the experiences I've had over the years. 

> My work is my humble gratitude for the men and women who have made me capable of taking the risks that I have.
