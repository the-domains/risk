> At an early age life presented a path of discovery to freely learn & experience many different walks of life. 

> After attending the University of Toronto I discovered an outlet in architectural designing and completed my education at the Northern Alberta Institution of Technology and have been continually expanding my knowledge of landscaping & interior design online.
