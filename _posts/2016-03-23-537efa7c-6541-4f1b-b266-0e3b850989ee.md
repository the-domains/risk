> At an early age, life presented me the path of discovery, to freely learn & experience many different walks of life. 

> It was after attending university that I discovered an outlet for my creativity and completed my architectural education at the Northern Alberta Institution of Technology and began to expand my knowledge of landscaping & interior design online.

> Today I feel free & energized when an someone asks for my opinion regarding their yard or how we can reuse an unused part of their home.
