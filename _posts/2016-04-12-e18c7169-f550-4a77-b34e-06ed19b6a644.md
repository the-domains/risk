# Early Spring**.Check for signs of growth.**

Did you remember to plant snow crocus last fall   
[Learn how to force branches into bloom][0].

**Prep the beds**.  
Remove winter mulch or, if well composted, work into the top layer of the soil. Work in some leaf mold or well-rotted manure, too.

**Prune**.

Now is the time to trim fruit trees if you didn't prune in winter. Prune before buds begin to break into bloom or you'll stress the tree and get a tiny crop (or possibly none).

**Perform basic maintenance.**  
Check stonework for frost heaves. Check and clean the [deck ][1]now so you don't have to do it later; make any repairs.

**Start seeds indoors.**You've spent the winter reading seed and plant catalogs, so try some.

[Learn more about seed-starting][2].

**Plant veggies.**  
Hardy vegetables, such as onions, potatoes, artichokes, and some lettuces, should be planted now.  
[See what other veggies do best in cool weather][3].

**Divide perennials**.  
Before plants have begun spring growth is a good time to divide many perennials. Share some divisions with your friends this year.

## Mid-Spring

**Build new flower beds.**  
This year, install complementary shrubs offering blooms throughout the season.  
[See which shrurs flower the most in the summer.][4]

**Stop feeding the birds.**  
Take down and clean feeders, put them away until fall.

**Enjoy the spring show.**  
Resolve to plant more spring-flowering bulbs next fall.

**Plant hardy annuals.**  
Sow seeds outdoors or transplant seedlings.

**Apply mulch.**  
If you mulch now, you'll have next-to-no weeding come summer.  
[Learn more about the different varieties of mulch][5].

## Late Spring

**Deadhead bulbs. **Remove spent blossoms from spring-flowering bulbs; let foliage die back without removing it.

**Go shopping. **Pick out flats of your favourite [bedding ][6]plants; remember to pick ones not yet in bloom for stronger plants.

**Prune spring-flowering shrubs. **Trim away spent blooms, and thin too-thick branches to rejuvenate older plants.
