As we begin to prioritize the needs of your family we will provide several designs that we believe will suit your family until you too believe you've found the home you've been dreaming about.

# Staying within Budget!

Once the drawings are done we are ready to purchase materials and build!

Knowing that there is nothing worse than receiving a bill that is way out of budget. We use an integrated approach to track necessary materials and trades for your project as we are designing.

## Minimizing time between design & construction.
