## We believe that design & build go hand in hand

The information below is the beginning of your home as you need it today, together we will design the home you will grow into as a family.

Your Name + Contact Information

Lot Location

Approximate Size

Building Type

Attached Garage or Detached + Number of Cars

Walkout Basement or Standard Flat Lot

Preferences

As we begin to prioritize the needs of your family we will provide several designs that we believe will suit your family until you too believe you've found the home you've been dreaming about.

# Staying within Budget!

Once the drawings are done we are ready to purchase materials and build!

Knowing that there is nothing worse than receiving a bill that is way out of budget. We use an integrated approach to track necessary materials and trades for your project as we are designing.

# Allowing us to minimize turn around between design & construction.
